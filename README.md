# Cronikl

Cronikl is a neat little app that lets you manage cron jobs with a simple UI, running commands on the schedule you define.

It was built as a working demonstration of the [NativePHP framework](https://nativephp.com/) of which I am one of the maintainers.

Cronikl is just a Laravel application that uses the [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/) running in the [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) variant of NativePHP.

**NB: You need to leave the app open for the scheduler to run your tasks.**

Cronikl currently supports macOS only, but Linux and Windows support is coming.

## Sponsorship
Cronikl is completely free to use for personal or commercial use. If it's making your job easier or you just want to
make sure it keeps being supported and improved, I'd really appreciate your donations!
